# Forecaster

## Description

This project took a LOT longer than I was expecting it to, and honestly is not fully up to par with the level that I would like it to be. It was a really good experience working with the API as well as local storage and those were both painpoints throughout the project overall. As it is currently, the Weather API seems to be only providing current day weather up to a certain point in the day and then it will only get weather for the next five days. For me this time seems to be around 2:30pm MST so later I will have to take a look into likely some of the time logic and figure out if it is an API call issue or what is really going on.

I learned a good amount of de-bugging from this when it comes to working with API and Local Storage and how it all interacts as far as scoping goes. One of the hardest things for me was getting the buttons to work with the local storage smoothly and had to go through various itterations of attempts to get my thoughts working and the code running smoothly.

## Usage

The intended usage of this site is to go and access the site (https://sikoticvinyl.github.io/Forecaster/) and search for a city and get a five day weather forcast and ideally todays weather. Depending on time of day current weather may not currently be working fully.
